## Key Technical Implementation

### Data Architecture Decisions

- **Rationale**: Complete data for accurate cultural personas vs. assumptions from incomplete data

#### Exclusions Per User Requirements
- **NO Credit Risk Scoring**: User explicit directive "in sdai dont credit risk andn caompains"
