# Data Storytelling Checklist

**Baseline standard for Scout Analytics dashboard design and development**

---

## âœ… What's Already Deployed (Storytelling-Compliant)

### **Headline KPI Cards with Deltas**
Daily Volume, Daily Revenue, Avg Basket Size, Avg Duration with green/red % deltas â†’ quick "what changed" narrative.

### **Context-First Charting**
Default time-series for "Transaction Volume Trends" with clear labeling and single-color emphasis â†’ lowers cognitive load.

### **Guided Narrative Panel ("Transaction Trends Insights")**
Curated bullets (peak hours, weekend uplift, metro velocity, avg duration) + AI Recommendations â†’ converts raw data into actions.

### **Structured Exploration**
Tabs (Volume / Revenue / Basket Size / Duration) create a storyline: *how much â†’ how valuable â†’ how big â†’ how long*.

### **Filterable Framing**
Right rail with Analysis Mode (single / compare / multi), Brands, Categories, Locations, Time & Temporal â†’ adapts stories to different audiences without rebuilding.

### **Temporal Framing**
Daily period selection and "Trend Analysis / Show Delta" â†’ supports *then vs now* comparisons.

### **Export & Refresh**
One-click Export and Refresh â†’ keeps the story current and shareable.

### **Information Architecture**
Left navigation mirrors a classic story arc:
Transaction Trends â†’ Product Mix â†’ Consumer Behavior â†’ Consumer Profiling â†’ Competitive â†’ Geographical.
(From *what's happening* to *why it's happening* to *where to act*.)

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Missing (Quick Wins to Make It Airtight)

### **Inline Annotations on Charts**
Peak callouts (e.g., "Sep 3: payday bump +18%") and weekend shading.
â†’ Add badges + legend item for "weekend."

### **Compare Mode Visuals**
When "vs previous" is on, show dual line or ghost overlay with end-point lift labels.

### **Small Multiples**
With brand/category filters, render mini trend strips (sparklines) for fast pattern scanning.

### **Confidence & Sample Notes**
Tiny footnote under insights: filters applied, N size, data span, last refresh â†’ avoids misreads.

### **Bookmark/Share States**
"Copy story link" that preserves filters + tab â†’ lets teams share identical views.

### **KPI Tooltips**
Define formula + period for each KPI to prevent drift in interpretation.

### **Narrative Template**
"Generate brief" button outputs 4 bullets: *What changed, Where, Why (hypothesis), What to do next*â€”auto-filled from insights.

### **Accessibility Polish**
Contrast-check the yellows; add keyboard focus for right-rail filters.
