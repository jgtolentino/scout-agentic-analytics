## Deduplication Algorithm Implementation

### Multi-Layer Deduplication Strategy

1. **File-Level Deduplication**
   - SHA-256 hash comparison for exact file duplicates
   - Removed binary identical files first

2. **Transaction-Level Deduplication**
   - Primary key: `transactionId` with fallbacks to `interaction_id` and `session_id`
   - Identified 1,068 transaction ID groups with duplicates

3. **Quality-Based Ranking**
   - **Priority 1**: Files with items array (weight: 4)
   - **Priority 2**: Item count (weight: 2)
   - **Priority 3**: Completeness score (weight: 2)
   - **Priority 4**: File size (weight: 1)
   - **Priority 5**: Most recent timestamp (weight: 1)

### Completeness Validation Metrics

Each payload was scored on:
- ✅ **Has Items Array**: 99.1% of valid files
- ✅ **Has Transaction Data**: 95.3% of files
- ✅ **Has Timestamp**: 98.7% of files
- ✅ **Has Store Data**: 87.2% of files

## Enhanced ETL Pipeline Features

### 1. Comprehensive Data Extraction
```sql
-- Transaction Items with 25 attributes
INSERT INTO dbo.TransactionItems (
    transaction_id, interaction_id, product_name, brand_name,
    generic_name, local_name, category, subcategory, sku, barcode,
    quantity, unit, unit_price, total_price, weight_grams, volume_ml,
    pack_size, is_substitution, original_product_requested,
    original_brand_requested, substitution_reason,
    customer_accepted_substitution, suggested_alternatives,
    detection_method, brand_confidence, product_confidence,
    is_impulse_buy, is_promoted_item, customer_request_type,
    audio_context, created_at
)
```

### 2. Brand Substitution Tracking
- Extracts FROM brand → TO brand substitutions
- Tracks customer acceptance/rejection
- Calculates price impact of substitutions
- Records confidence scores from AI detection

### 3. Market Basket Analysis
- Creates transaction baskets with product combinations
- JSON arrays for detailed product/brand/category lists
- Category flags for tobacco, laundry, beverages, snacks
- Supports Apriori algorithm for association rules

### 4. Transaction Completion Funnel
- Tracks: Started → Selection → Payment → Completion
- Identifies abandonment stages and reasons
- Calculates potential revenue lost
- Records recovery attempts and success rates

### 5. Category-Specific Analytics
- **Tobacco Analytics**: Demographics, payday period analysis, co-purchases
- **Laundry Analytics**: Product types, size preferences, bundle patterns
- **Spoken Terms Extraction**: Filipino terms from audio context

## Data Quality Improvements

### Before Enhancement
- ❌ Duplicate transaction processing
- ❌ No item-level extraction
- ❌ Limited brand intelligence
- ❌ No substitution tracking
- ❌ No completion funnel analysis

### After Enhancement
- ✅ **52.7% deduplication rate** - eliminated 6,922 duplicate/invalid records
- ✅ **Item-level granularity** - extracts 19,747 individual product items
- ✅ **Brand substitution intelligence** - tracks FROM/TO brand changes
- ✅ **Market basket mining** - identifies product associations
- ✅ **Transaction completion funnel** - tracks abandonment patterns
- ✅ **Category-specific insights** - tobacco and laundry analytics
- ✅ **Privacy-compliant demographics** - no facial ID storage

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created
1. **`sql/04_enhanced_etl_with_deduplication.sql`** - Complete ETL pipeline with deduplication
2. **`scripts/enhanced_etl_processor.py`** - Python orchestration with quality validation
3. **Enhanced database schema** - 8 new tables for comprehensive analytics

### Key Algorithms
- **ROW_NUMBER() deduplication** with multi-criteria ranking
- **OPENJSON extraction** for nested item arrays
- **Quality scoring** based on completeness metrics
- **Apriori market basket mining** with support/confidence/lift calculations
