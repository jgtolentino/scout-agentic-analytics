## 🔧 Operational Procedures

### Daily Operations
1. **Automated Nightly Run**: `./scripts/nightly_runner.sh`
   - Runs comprehensive validation
   - Captures system metrics
   - Generates alerts if needed
   - Sends notifications to configured webhooks

2. **New Store Detection**: `./scripts/new_store_detector.sh`
   - Detects unverified stores automatically
   - Creates tickets with SQL remediation templates
   - Tracks resolution progress

3. **Analytics Export**: `./scripts/analytics_export.sh`
   - Exports client-ready CSV files daily
   - Uploads to Azure Blob Storage (if configured)
   - Maintains data lineage through manifests

### Emergency Procedures

#### Adding New Stores
```sql
-- Use enhanced validation function
SELECT * FROM add_store_with_enhanced_validation(
    p_store_id := [STORE_ID],
    p_store_name := '[VERIFIED_NAME]',
    p_municipality := '[NCR_MUNICIPALITY]',
    p_barangay := '[VERIFIED_BARANGAY]',
    p_latitude := [LAT_14.2_TO_14.9],
    p_longitude := [LON_120.9_TO_121.2]
);
```

#### System Health Check
```bash
# Quick status check
./zero_trust_runner.sh check

# Full validation suite
./scripts/nightly_runner.sh validate

# Monitor SLOs
psql "$DB_URL" -c "SELECT * FROM ops.evaluate_slos();"
```

#### Emergency Recovery
```sql
-- Check for data integrity issues
SELECT * FROM comprehensive_zero_trust_validation();

-- Emergency store recovery
SELECT * FROM emergency_store_recovery([STORE_ID]);

-- System health overview
SELECT * FROM ops.dashboard_real_time;
```

## 🚨 Alert Configuration

### Webhook Integration
Set environment variables for automated notifications:
```bash
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/..."
export TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL="https://outlook.office.com/webhook/..."
```

### Alert Thresholds
- **CRITICAL**: Verification rate < 100%, Integrity violations > 0
- **HIGH**: Payload violations > 0, Store coverage issues
- **MEDIUM**: Coordinate violations > 0, Runner freshness > 24h
- **LOW**: Performance degradation, Warning conditions

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Database Performance
- Indexed queries for analytics views
- Optimized JSON operations with GIN indexes
- Efficient time-based partitioning ready

### Monitoring Efficiency
- Real-time dashboard queries: <100ms
- Comprehensive validation: <2 seconds
- SLO evaluation: <1 second
- Alert generation: <500ms

### Resource Usage

- Analytics views: Query-time computation (no storage)
- Automated scripts: <10MB log files per day

## 🔒 Security & Compliance

### Access Control
- `analytics_reader` role for read-only analytics access
- Separate `ops` schema for operational monitoring
- Principle of least privilege for all functions

### Data Protection
- No sensitive data exposure in logs
- Webhook notifications exclude PII
- Export files contain only aggregated metrics

### Audit Trail
