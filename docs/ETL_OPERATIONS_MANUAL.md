-- Monitor ML column mapping performance
WITH mapping_stats AS (
  SELECT
    file_format,
    AVG((column_mappings->>'mapping_confidence')::decimal) as avg_mapping_confidence,
    COUNT(*) as total_files
  FROM staging.universal_file_ingestion
  WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
    AND column_mappings IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY file_format
)
SELECT * FROM mapping_stats
WHERE avg_mapping_confidence < 0.85;  -- Alert threshold
```

-- Validate data completeness in Silver layer
WITH completeness_check AS (
  SELECT
    data_source,
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE brand_name IS NOT NULL) as branded_records,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE product_category IS NOT NULL) as categorized_records,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE amount > 0) as valid_amounts
  FROM silver.transactions_cleaned
  WHERE loaded_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
  GROUP BY data_source
)
SELECT
  data_source,
  total_records,
  ROUND((branded_records::numeric / total_records * 100), 2) as brand_completeness_pct,
  ROUND((categorized_records::numeric / total_records * 100), 2) as category_completeness_pct,
  ROUND((valid_amounts::numeric / total_records * 100), 2) as amount_validity_pct
FROM completeness_check
WHERE branded_records::numeric / total_records < 0.8;  -- Alert threshold
```

**Action**: If brand_completeness_pct < 80% → Review brand detection logic

#### Gate 5: Business Rule Validation
```sql
-- Validate business rules compliance
SELECT
  'Revenue consistency' as check_type,
  COUNT(*) as violations
FROM scout.scout_gold_transactions sgt

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue 1: Format Detection Failures
**Symptoms**:
- Low detection confidence (<0.8)
- Files stuck in 'processing' status
- Unknown format errors

**Diagnosis**:
```sql
-- Check failed format detections
SELECT
  file_name,
  file_format,
  detection_confidence,
  processing_metadata->'error' as error_details
FROM staging.universal_file_ingestion
WHERE detection_confidence < 0.8
  OR status = 'failed'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Manual Format Override**: Use `forceFormat` parameter
2. **File Preprocessing**: Clean file headers/encoding
3. **Detection Logic Update**: Enhance format detection rules

#### Issue 2: ML Column Mapping Failures
**Symptoms**:
- Low mapping confidence (<0.8)
- Incorrect column assignments
- Missing business-critical fields

**Diagnosis**:
```sql
-- Analyze column mapping accuracy
SELECT
  file_format,
  COUNT(*) as total_files,
  AVG((column_mappings->>'mapping_confidence')::decimal) as avg_confidence,
  ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT jsonb_object_keys(column_mappings->'column_mappings')) as mapped_columns
FROM staging.universal_file_ingestion
WHERE column_mappings IS NOT NULL
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY file_format
HAVING AVG((column_mappings->>'mapping_confidence')::decimal) < 0.85;
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Retrain ML Model**: Update with recent mapping examples
2. **Manual Mapping Rules**: Add explicit column mappings
3. **Threshold Adjustment**: Lower confidence threshold temporarily

#### Issue 3: Silver Layer Quality Issues
**Symptoms**:
- High null/missing values
- Quality score drops
- Business rule violations

**Diagnosis**:
```sql
-- Quality issue analysis
WITH quality_analysis AS (
  SELECT
    data_source,
    brand_name,
    product_category,
    COUNT(*) as record_count,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE amount IS NULL OR amount <= 0) as invalid_amounts,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE quality_score < 0.7) as low_quality,
    AVG(quality_score) as avg_quality
  FROM silver.transactions_cleaned
  WHERE loaded_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
  GROUP BY data_source, brand_name, product_category
)
SELECT * FROM quality_analysis
WHERE avg_quality < 0.8 OR invalid_amounts::numeric / record_count > 0.1
ORDER BY avg_quality ASC;
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Data Validation Rules**: Strengthen validation logic
2. **Source Data Quality**: Work with data providers
3. **Enrichment Logic**: Improve missing data handling

#### Issue 4: Performance Degradation
**Symptoms**:
- Processing times >2x normal
- Memory/CPU resource exhaustion
- Timeout errors

**Diagnosis**:
```sql
-- Performance analysis
SELECT
  function_name,
  DATE_TRUNC('hour', created_at) as hour,
  COUNT(*) as executions,
  AVG(duration_ms) as avg_duration,
  MAX(duration_ms) as max_duration,
  percentile_cont(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY duration_ms) as p95_duration
FROM metadata.function_audit
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY function_name, DATE_TRUNC('hour', created_at)
HAVING AVG(duration_ms) > 2000
ORDER BY avg_duration DESC;
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Resource Scaling**: Increase memory/CPU allocation
